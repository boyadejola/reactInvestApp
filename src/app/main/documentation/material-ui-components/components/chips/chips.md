# Chip

<p class="description">Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.</p>

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

While included here as a standalone component, the most common use will
be in some form of input, so some of the behavior demonstrated here is
not shown in context.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Basic chip

The `Chip` component supports outlined and filled styling.

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/BasicChips.js"}}

## Chip actions

You can use the following actions.

- Chips with the `onClick` prop defined change appearance on focus, hover, and click.
- Chips with the `onDelete` prop defined will display a delete icon which changes appearance on hover.

### Clickable

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/ClickeableChips.js"}}

### Deletable

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/DeleteableChips.js"}}

### Clickable and deletable

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/ClickeableAndDeleteableChips.js"}}

### Clickable link

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/ClickeableLinkChips.js"}}

### Custom delete icon

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/CustomDeleteIconChips.js"}}

## Chip adornments

You can add ornaments to the beginning of the component.

Use the `avatar` prop to added a avatar or use the `icon` prop to added a icon.

### Avatar chip

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/AvatarChips.js"}}

### Icon chip

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/IconChips.js"}}

## Color chip

You can use the `color` prop to define a color from theme palette.

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/ColorChips.js"}}

## Sizes chip

You can use the `size` prop to define a small Chip.

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/SizesChips.js"}}

## Chip array

An example of rendering multiple chips from an array of values.
Deleting a chip removes it from the array. Note that since no
`onClick` prop is defined, the `Chip` can be focused, but does not
gain depth while clicked or touched.

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/ChipsArray.js", "bg": true}}

## Chip playground

{{"demo": "pages/components/chips/ChipsPlayground.js", "hideToolbar": true}}

## Accessibility

If the Chip is deletable or clickable then it is a button in tab order. When the Chip is focused (e.g. when tabbing) releasing (`keyup` event) `Backspace` or `Delete` will call the `onDelete` handler while releasing `Escape` will blur the Chip.

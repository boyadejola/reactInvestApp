# CSS Baseline

<p class="description">MUI provides a CssBaseline component to kickstart an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Global reset

You might be familiar with [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), a collection of HTML element and attribute style-normalizations.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <CssBaseline />
      {/* The rest of your application */}
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

## Scoping on children

However, you might be progressively migrating a website to MUI, using a global reset might not be an option.
It's possible to apply the baseline only to the children by using the `ScopedCssBaseline` component.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import ScopedCssBaseline from "@mui/material/ScopedCssBaseline";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ScopedCssBaseline>
      {/* The rest of your application */}
      <MyApp />
    </ScopedCssBaseline>
  );
}
```

⚠️ Make sure you import `ScopedCssBaseline` first to avoid box-sizing conflicts as in the above example.

## Approach

### Page

The `<html>` and `<body>` elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:

- The margin in all browsers is removed.
- The default Material Design background color is applied.
  It's using [`theme.palette.background.default`](/customization/default-theme/?expand-path=$.palette.background) for standard devices and a white background for print devices.

### Layout

- `box-sizing` is set globally on the `<html>` element to `border-box`.
  Every element—including `*::before` and `*::after` are declared to inherit this property,
  which ensures that the declared width of the element is never exceeded due to padding or border.

### Scrollbars

The colors of the scrollbars can be customized to improve the contrast (especially on Windows). Add this code to your theme (for dark mode).

```jsx
import darkScrollbar from "@mui/material/darkScrollbar";

const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiCssBaseline: {
      styleOverrides: {
        body: theme.palette.mode === "dark" ? darkScrollbar() : null,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This website uses `darkScrollbar` when dark mode is enabled.
Be aware, however, that using this utility (and customizing `-webkit-scrollbar`) forces MacOS to always show the scrollbar.

### Typography

- No base font-size is declared on the `<html>`, but 16px is assumed (the browser default).
  You can learn more about the implications of changing the `<html>` default font size in [the theme documentation](/customization/typography/#typography-html-font-size) page.
- Set the `theme.typography.body1` style on the `<body>` element.
- Set the font-weight to `theme.typography.fontWeightBold` for the `<b>` and `<strong>` elements.
- Custom font-smoothing is enabled for better display of the Roboto font.

## Customization

Head to the [global customization](/customization/how-to-customize/#5-global-css-override) section of the documentation to change the output of these components.
